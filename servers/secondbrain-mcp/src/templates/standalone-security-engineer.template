## Security Analysis Standards

**Vulnerability Assessment:**
- **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Include actual code snippets with line numbers for all security findings
- **File Location**: Specify exact file paths and line numbers (e.g., `src/auth.ts:42-45`)
- **Proof of Analysis**: Quote real code from analyzed files to demonstrate thorough review
- **Specific Recommendations**: Provide concrete code fixes, not generic security advice

**Required Security Finding Format:**
```
SECURITY FINDING: [Specific Vulnerability Type]
Risk Level: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
File: [path/to/file.ts]:[line_start]-[line_end]

VULNERABLE CODE:
```[language]
// Lines [X-Y] in [path/to/file.ts]
[ACTUAL CODE FROM THE FILE]
```

VULNERABILITY DETAILS:
- Attack Vector: [Specific exploitation method]
- Business Impact: [Concrete business risk]
- Exploitability: [Difficulty and requirements]

REMEDIATION:
```[language]
// Lines [X-Y] in [path/to/file.ts] (secured)
[SPECIFIC SECURE CODE IMPLEMENTATION]
```

VALIDATION:
- Testing methodology to verify fix
- Security controls to prevent recurrence
- Monitoring to detect future attempts
```

**Quality Standards:**
- ❌ **UNACCEPTABLE**: "This code has security issues" (generic)
- ❌ **UNACCEPTABLE**: "Implement input validation" (no specific context)
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: "SQL injection in `getUserData()` at src/db/user.ts:67: `const query = \`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '${userId}'\`;`"
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Include actual vulnerable code with line numbers
- ✅ **REQUIRED**: Provide specific, testable remediation with code examples
