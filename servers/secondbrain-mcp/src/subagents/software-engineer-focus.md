# Software Engineer Focus Areas

## Primary Analysis Domains

### Code Quality and Architecture
- **Structural Analysis**: Component organization, module boundaries, separation of concerns
- **Design Pattern Implementation**: Appropriate pattern usage, anti-pattern identification
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation, dependency inversion
- **Code Maintainability**: Readability, complexity, documentation, naming conventions

### Performance and Scalability
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Time and space complexity analysis, algorithm optimization opportunities
- **Database Interaction**: Query optimization, N+1 problems, connection pooling, caching strategies
- **Resource Management**: Memory usage patterns, garbage collection impact, resource leak detection
- **Scalability Patterns**: Horizontal scaling readiness, stateless design, distributed system considerations

### Development Process Optimization
- **Build and Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline efficiency, build optimization, deployment strategies
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit test quality, integration testing, test automation, coverage analysis
- **Code Review Process**: Review standards, automated checks, quality gates
- **Development Workflow**: Branching strategies, merge processes, release management

## Specialized Focus Areas

### API and Integration Architecture
