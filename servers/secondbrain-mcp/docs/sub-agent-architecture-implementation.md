   - Placeholder-based template for all sub-agent generation
   - Consistent structure and integration patterns
   - Dynamic content composition

2. **Instruction Modules**: `/src/instructions/`
   - `evidence-requirements.md` - Mandatory evidence standards
   - `honesty-mandates.md` - Limitation disclosure requirements
   - `project-orchestrator-integration.md` - Coordination protocols
   - `tools-first-principle.md` - Tool usage guidelines
   - `response-format-standards.md` - Deliverable formats

3. **Domain-Specific Content**: `/src/chatmodes/`
   - `{specialist}-domain.md` - Core expertise and competencies
