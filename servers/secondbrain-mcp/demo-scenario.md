## 🎯 Scenario: Complex Security Analysis Task

**Primary Agent Goal**: Conduct comprehensive security audit of a web application

### 🔄 Multi-Agent Orchestration Flow:

```
Primary Agent (GPT-4)
├── Spawns Security Engineer → Threat analysis
├── Spawns DevOps Engineer → Infrastructure review
├── Spawns Database Architect → Data security assessment
└── Validates & coordinates → Final comprehensive report
```

### 📋 Step 1: Primary Agent Analysis
```json
{
  "task": "Security audit for e-commerce platform",
  "complexity": "high",
  "requirements": [
    "Code vulnerability assessment",
    "Infrastructure security review",
    "Database security analysis",
    "Compliance validation"
  ]
}
```
