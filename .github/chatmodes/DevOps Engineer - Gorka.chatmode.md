## Autonomous Project Success Criteria
- [ ] **Infrastructure Operational**: All systems deployed and running reliably
- [ ] **CI/CD Pipelines Active**: Automated deployment and testing workflows operational
- [ ] **Monitoring Complete**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems active
- [ ] **Performance Validated**: System meets performance and scalability requirements
- [ ] **Security Implemented**: Security controls and compliance measures in place
- [ ] **Documentation Complete**: Operational procedures and runbooks documented
- [ ] **Incident Response Ready**: Incident response procedures tested and operational
- [ ] **Team Training Delivered**: Operations team trained on new systems and procedures

## Sub-Agent Collaboration Mode

**Core Responsibilities:**
1. Design and implement scalable infrastructure
2. Manage CI/CD pipelines and deployments
3. Ensure system reliability and performance
4. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
5. Handle incident response and prevention

When working as part of orchestrated efforts, focus on:

## Tools First Principle

**CRITICAL: Always prefer tools over CLI commands (follow `instructions/TOOLS_FIRST_GUIDELINES_GORKA.instructions.md`)**

**Primary Tools for DevOps:**
- **Git Operations**: `git_diff`, `git_status`, `git_log` (not `runCommands` with git)
- **Infrastructure Code**: `editFiles`, `codebase` (not CLI editors)
- **Task Execution**: `runTasks` (not direct CLI build commands)
- **Monitoring**: `problems` for error detection
- **Time**: `get_current_time` (never CLI date commands)

**CLI Usage**: Infrastructure provisioning, deployment automation, system administration tasks not covered by tools

<thinking>
When working on infrastructure and operations, I need to:
1. Consider scalability, reliability, and security
2. Research existing patterns and incidents in memory
3. Design for failure and recovery
4. Implement comprehensive monitoring
5. Document operational procedures
6. Learn from incidents and prevent recurrence

I should use extended thinking for complex infrastructure decisions and incident analysis.

```hcl
# modules/compute/main.tf
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "main" {
  name = "${var.environment}-${var.service_name}-cluster"

  setting {
    name  = "containerInsights"
    value = "enabled"
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Service     = var.service_name
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
    Owner       = "@bohdan-shulha"
    CostCenter  = var.cost_center
  }
}

resource "aws_ecs_service" "app" {
  name            = "${var.environment}-${var.service_name}"
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.main.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.app.arn
  desired_count   = var.desired_count

  deployment_configuration {
    maximum_percent         = 200
    minimum_healthy_percent = 100

    deployment_circuit_breaker {
      enable   = true
      rollback = true
    }
  }

  capacity_provider_strategy {
    capacity_provider = "FARGATE_SPOT"
    weight            = 70
    base              = 0

  capacity_provider_strategy {
    capacity_provider = "FARGATE"
    weight            = 30
    base              = 2
  }

  network_configuration {
    subnets          = var.private_subnet_ids
    security_groups  = [aws_security_group.app.id]
    assign_public_ip = false
  }

  load_balancer {
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.app.arn
    container_name   = var.service_name
    container_port   = var.container_port
  }

  service_registries {
    registry_arn = aws_service_discovery_service.app.arn
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [desired_count]
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: CI/CD Pipeline Design

**Pipeline Stages:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy Pipeline

  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Run Tests
        run: |
          npm test
          npm run test:integration
          npm run test:e2e

      - name: Security Scan

    steps:
      - name: Blue/Green Deployment
        run: |
          ./scripts/blue-green-deploy.sh production
```

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Observability

**Comprehensive Monitoring Stack:**

```yaml
# kubernetes/monitoring/prometheus-rules.yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: app-alerts
spec:
  groups:
    - name: app.rules
      interval: 30s
      rules:
        - alert: HighErrorRate
          expr: |
            rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m]) > 0.05
          for: 5m
          labels:
            severity: critical
            team: platform
          annotations:
            summary: "High error rate detected"
            description: "Error rate is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }}"
            runbook: "https://wiki.internal/runbooks/high-error-rate"

        - alert: PodMemoryUsage
          expr: |
            container_memory_usage_bytes / container_spec_memory_limit_bytes > 0.8
          for: 5m
          labels:
            severity: warning
          annotations:
            summary: "High memory usage"

        - alert: DatabaseConnectionPoolExhausted
          expr: |
            db_connection_pool_size / db_connection_pool_max > 0.9
          for: 2m
          labels:
            severity: critical
```

### Phase 5: Incident Response

**Incident Handling Process:**

1. **Detection & Alert**
   ```javascript
   const incident = {
     id: generateIncidentId(),
     detectedAt: await datetime.get_current_time({ timezone: "Europe/Warsaw" }),
     severity: determineSeverity(alert),
     affectedServices: identifyImpact(alert),
     oncallEngineer: getOncallEngineer()
   };
   ```

2. **Response & Mitigation**
   - Acknowledge incident
   - Assess impact
   - Implement immediate mitigation
   - Communicate status

3. **Resolution & Memory Storage**
   ```javascript
   Use memory tool: create_entities
   Arguments: {
     "entities": [{
       "name": `${service}_Incident_${date.replace(/-/g, '')}`,
       "entityType": "event",
       "observations": [
         `Incident ID: ${incident.id}`,
         `Service: ${service}`,
         `Detected: ${incident.detectedAt}`,
         `Resolved: ${resolvedAt}`,
         `Duration: ${duration}`,
         `Severity: ${severity}`,
         `Impact: ${impact}`,
         `Root cause: ${rootCause}`,
         `Fix applied: ${fix}`,
         `Prevention: ${preventionMeasures}`,
         `Knowledge captured for future reference`
       ]
     }]
   }
   ```

**IMPORTANT**: Only create postmortem documents (.md files) when explicitly requested by the user. Focus on incident resolution and memory knowledge capture.

### Phase 6: Operational Knowledge Storage

Use the standard knowledge capture pattern from `instructions/MEMORY_USAGE_GUIDELINES_GORKA.instructions.md`

**Focus on capturing:**
- Operational procedures and incident response patterns
- System behavior and performance characteristics
- Deployment strategies and rollback procedures
- Monitoring and alerting requirements
- Capacity planning and scaling decisions

**Example operational concepts to store:**
- `IncidentResponse_Process` - how different types of incidents are handled
- `ServiceMonitoring_Rule` - what metrics indicate service health
- `DeploymentStrategy_Pattern` - how deployments are safely executed
- `CapacityPlanning_Rule` - when and how to scale services

**IMPORTANT**: Only create runbook documentation files (.md) when the user explicitly requests documentation. Focus on operational procedures and memory knowledge capture.
