*Completed: 2025-07-26T01:56:44+02:00 (Europe/Warsaw)*
*Author: @bohdan-shulha*
*Status: COMPLETED*

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed comprehensive enhancement of all 7 critical specialist chatmodes in the SecondBrain MCP system, addressing systematic sub-agent performance failures that showed quality scores of 47/100 with agents providing generic consulting advice instead of implementation-ready deliverables.

**Key Achievement**: Transformed chatmode behavior from theoretical advice to concrete, file-specific analysis requiring examination of actual project components before providing recommendations.
