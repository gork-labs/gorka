## Overview

Sequential thinking is the foundation of quality analysis in the Gorka system. Every complex task now requires structured, progressive analysis using the `mcp_sequentialthi_sequentialthinking` tool, ensuring thorough consideration of all aspects before reaching conclusions.

## Why Sequential Thinking is Required

### The Problem with Immediate Responses
Without structured thinking:
- **Edge cases missed**: Quick responses often overlook important considerations
- **Incomplete analysis**: Complex problems require multi-faceted examination
- **Inconsistent quality**: Results vary widely based on initial interpretation
- **No revision opportunity**: First impressions may be wrong

### The Sequential Thinking Solution
With mandatory structured thinking:
- **Progressive insight building**: Each thought builds on previous understanding
- **Multiple perspectives**: Natural consideration of different viewpoints
- **Revision capability**: Early thoughts can be reconsidered with new insights
- **Consistent depth**: Every complex task gets thorough analysis
- **Transparent reasoning**: You can see exactly how conclusions were reached

## Thinking Depth Requirements

### Complexity-Based Requirements
- **Simple queries**: 7-9 thoughts minimum
  - Basic information gathering
  - Straightforward analysis
  - Clear-cut decisions

- **Standard analysis**: 10-12 thoughts minimum
  - Multi-factor problems
  - Design decisions
  - Technical reviews

- **Complex problems**: 13-15 thoughts minimum
  - Architecture decisions
  - Multi-stakeholder considerations
  - System-wide implications

- **Ultra-complex scenarios**: 15+ thoughts
  - Major architectural changes
  - Cross-system integration
  - High-risk decisions

### When to Increase Thought Count
Start conservatively and expand when:
- Complexity emerges during analysis
- Multiple valid approaches exist
- Stakeholder perspectives differ
- Risk assessment reveals concerns
- Initial assumptions prove wrong

## How to Structure Thoughts Effectively

### Standard Thinking Flow

#### Thoughts 1-2: Understanding and Context
```
Thought 1: Problem Definition
- What exactly is being asked?
- What are the explicit requirements?
- What constraints exist?
- What success criteria apply?

Thought 2: Context Gathering
- What relevant information do I have?
- What domain knowledge applies?
- What assumptions am I making?
- What additional context do I need?
```

#### Thoughts 3-5: Analysis and Exploration
```
Thought 3: Problem Breakdown
- How can this be decomposed?
- What are the key factors?
- What relationships exist?
- What patterns apply?

Thought 4: Approach Exploration
- What options are available?
- What are the trade-offs?
- What risks exist?
- What opportunities emerge?

Thought 5: Multi-Perspective Analysis
- How do different stakeholders view this?
- What perspectives haven't been considered?
- What could go wrong?
- What are the long-term implications?
```

#### Thoughts 6-8: Synthesis and Decision
```
Thought 6: Option Evaluation
- Which approaches best meet requirements?
- How do trade-offs compare?
- What evidence supports each option?
- What are the decision criteria?

Thought 7: Risk Assessment
- What could go wrong with each option?
- How can risks be mitigated?
- What contingencies are needed?
- What monitoring is required?

Thought 8: Solution Synthesis
- What is the recommended approach?
- Why is this the best option?
- How should it be implemented?
- What are the next steps?
```

#### Thoughts 9+: Validation and Refinement
```
Thought 9: Validation Check
- Does this solution meet all requirements?
- Have all constraints been addressed?
- Are there any remaining gaps?
- Does the reasoning hold up?

Thought 10+: Optimization and Final Checks
- How can this be improved?
- What edge cases need consideration?
- Are there better alternatives?
- Is this ready for implementation?
```

## Advanced Thinking Techniques

### Revision and Course Correction
```
Use: isRevision=true, revisesThought=N
When: New information changes understanding
Example: "Revising my earlier assumption about performance requirements..."
```

### Branching for Alternatives
```
Use: branchFromThought=N, branchId="alternative_approach"
When: Multiple valid approaches exist
Example: "Exploring alternative: microservices vs. monolithic architecture"
```

### Dynamic Expansion
```
Use: needsMoreThoughts=true
When: Reaching thought limit but more analysis needed
Example: "Realizing this requires deeper security analysis..."
```

## Examples of Good Thought Patterns

### Example 1: Simple Analysis (8 thoughts)
```
Thought 1: Understanding the user's request for API documentation
Thought 2: Gathering context about existing API structure and standards
Thought 3: Identifying key documentation sections needed
Thought 4: Considering different documentation approaches
Thought 5: Evaluating audience needs (developers, integrators, end-users)
Thought 6: Determining optimal documentation format and tools
Thought 7: Planning structure and content organization
Thought 8: Finalizing approach with next steps and deliverables
```

### Example 2: Complex Architecture (15 thoughts)
```
Thought 1: Understanding the microservices migration requirements
Thought 2: Analyzing current monolithic architecture strengths/weaknesses
Thought 3: Identifying service boundaries and domain models
Thought 4: Evaluating data consistency and transaction requirements
Thought 5: Considering deployment and infrastructure implications
Thought 6: Assessing team structure and Conway's Law impacts
Thought 7: Analyzing migration strategy options (strangler fig vs. big bang)
Thought 8: Evaluating technology stack choices for new services
Thought 9: Considering service communication patterns and protocols
Thought 10: Analyzing monitoring and observability requirements
Thought 11: Assessing security and authentication changes needed
Thought 12: Evaluating performance implications and trade-offs
Thought 13: Planning rollback strategies and risk mitigation
Thought 14: Synthesizing recommended approach with phases
Thought 15: Validating solution against all requirements and constraints
```

## Common Patterns to Use

### Problem-Solving Pattern
1. **Define**: What exactly needs to be solved?
2. **Analyze**: What factors are involved?
3. **Generate**: What options exist?
4. **Evaluate**: Which options are best?
5. **Decide**: What's the recommended solution?
6. **Plan**: How will it be implemented?
7. **Validate**: Does this solve the problem?

### Design Pattern
1. **Requirements**: What needs to be achieved?
2. **Constraints**: What limitations exist?
3. **Options**: What approaches are possible?

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I don't have enough to think about"
**Solution**: Break down the problem further
- What assumptions are you making?
- What could go wrong?
- Who else is affected?
- What are the long-term implications?
- What alternatives exist?

### "My thoughts are repetitive"
**Solution**: Change perspective
- Look from different stakeholder viewpoints
- Consider different time horizons
- Examine different risk scenarios
- Explore alternative approaches
- Challenge your assumptions

### "I reached the minimum but need more"
**Solution**: Use dynamic expansion
- Set `needsMoreThoughts=true`
- Increase `totalThoughts`
- Continue with deeper analysis
- Use branching for alternatives
- Revise earlier thoughts if needed

### "I want to change an early thought"
**Solution**: Use revision capability
- Set `isRevision=true`
- Reference `revisesThought=N`
- Explain what changed your understanding
- Maintain consistency with later thoughts
- Update conclusions accordingly
