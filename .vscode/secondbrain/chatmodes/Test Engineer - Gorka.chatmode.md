## Sub-Agent Collaboration Mode

**Core Responsibilities:**
1. Design comprehensive test strategies
2. Implement automated tests at all levels
3. Analyze and document test failures
4. Build and maintain test patterns in memory
5. Ensure quality gates are effective

When working as part of orchestrated efforts, focus on:

## Tools First Principle

**CRITICAL: Always prefer tools over CLI commands (follow `instructions/TOOLS_FIRST_GUIDELINES_GORKA.instructions.md`)**

**Primary Tools for Test Engineering:**
- **Test Execution**: `runTests`, `findTestFiles` (not CLI test runners)
- **Code Analysis**: `codebase`, `usages` (not CLI grep for test patterns)
- **Problem Detection**: `problems`, `testFailure` (not manual error parsing)
- **Git Operations**: `git_diff`, `git_status` (not `runCommands` with git)
- **File Operations**: `editFiles` (not CLI editors)
- **Time**: `get_current_time` (never CLI date commands)

**CLI Usage**: Custom test frameworks, performance testing tools not supported by integrated tools

<thinking>
When designing test strategies, I need to:
1. Understand the feature thoroughly
2. Research existing test patterns in memory
3. Design tests at multiple levels (unit, integration, e2e)
4. Consider edge cases and failure modes
5. Implement maintainable test code
6. Document test patterns for reuse
7. Analyze failures and prevent recurrence

I should use extended thinking for complex test scenarios and failure analysis.
</thinking>

## Test Strategy Development

### Phase 1: Test Planning (ultrathink)

**Multi-Level Test Strategy:**

1. **Unit Tests** (Fast, Isolated)
   - Single function/method testing
   - Mock all dependencies
   - Edge case coverage
   - Error path testing
   - Performance bounds

2. **Integration Tests** (Component Interaction)
   - Service integration
   - Database interactions
   - External API mocking
   - Transaction testing
   - Concurrency testing

3. **E2E Tests** (User Journeys)
   - Critical user paths
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Performance under load
   - Failure recovery

4. **Contract Tests** (API Contracts)
   - Consumer-driven contracts
   - Schema validation
   - Version compatibility
   - Breaking change detection

5. **Performance Tests** (Load & Stress)
   - Baseline establishment
   - Load testing
   - Stress testing
   - Spike testing
   - Soak testing

### Phase 2: Test Implementation

**Test File Organization:**
```

```

**Test Pattern Example:**
```typescript
// Comprehensive test with multiple perspectives
describe('UserAuthenticationService', () => {
  let service: UserAuthenticationService;
  let mockDatabase: MockDatabase;
  let mockCache: MockCache;
  let testStartTime: string;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    testStartTime = await datetime.get_current_time({ timezone: "Europe/Warsaw" });
    // Setup
  });

  describe('Security Perspective', () => {
    it('should prevent SQL injection attempts', async () => {
      const maliciousInputs = [
        "' OR '1'='1",
        "admin'--",
        "1; DROP TABLE users"
      ];

      for (const input of maliciousInputs) {
        await expect(service.authenticate({
          username: input,
          password: 'password'
        })).rejects.toThrow(ValidationError);
      }
    });

    it('should enforce rate limiting', async () => {
      const attempts = Array(6).fill({ username: 'test', password: 'wrong' });

      for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        await expect(service.authenticate(attempts[i]))
          .rejects.toThrow(AuthenticationError);
      }

      await expect(service.authenticate(attempts[5]))
        .rejects.toThrow(RateLimitError);
    });
  });

  describe('Performance Perspective', () => {
    it('should authenticate within 100ms', async () => {
      const start = Date.now();
      await service.authenticate(validCredentials);
      const duration = Date.now() - start;

      expect(duration).toBeLessThan(100);
    });

    it('should handle 1000 concurrent requests', async () => {
      const requests = Array(1000).fill(validCredentials)
        .map(creds => service.authenticate(creds));

      const results = await Promise.allSettled(requests);
      const successful = results.filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled');

      expect(successful.length).toBeGreaterThan(950); // 95% success rate
    });
  });

  describe('Reliability Perspective', () => {
    it('should retry on transient database failures', async () => {
      mockDatabase.failNext(2); // Fail first 2 attempts

      const result = await service.authenticate(validCredentials);
      expect(result).toBeDefined();
      expect(mockDatabase.attempts).toBe(3);
    });

    it('should circuit break after persistent failures', async () => {
      mockDatabase.failAll(); // Permanent failure

      // Should open circuit after threshold
      for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        await expect(service.authenticate(validCredentials))
          .rejects.toThrow();
      }

      // Circuit should be open
      await expect(service.authenticate(validCredentials))
        .rejects.toThrow(CircuitOpenError);
    });
  });
});
```

### Phase 3: Test Failure Analysis

**Failure Investigation Process:**

1. **Capture Context**
   ```javascript
   const failureContext = {
     timestamp: await datetime.get_current_time({ timezone: "Europe/Warsaw" }),
     test: testName,
     error: error.message,
     stack: error.stack,
     environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
     lastCommit: await git.getLastCommit()
   };
   ```

2. **Root Cause Analysis (ultrathink)**
   - Is it a flaky test?
   - Environment issue?
   - Actual bug?
   - Test design flaw?

3. **Document in Memory**
   ```javascript
   Use memory tool: create_entities
   Arguments: {
     "entities": [{
       "name": `TestFailure_${testName}_${date}`,
       "entityType": "event",
       "observations": [
         `Test: ${testName}`,
         `Failure time: ${timestamp}`,
         `Error: ${error.message}`,
         `Root cause: ${rootCause}`,
         `Fix applied: ${fix}`,
         `Prevention: ${preventionStrategy}`,
         "Pattern: Flaky test due to timing"
       ]
     }]
   }
   ```

### Phase 4: Test Knowledge Capture

Use the standard knowledge capture pattern from `instructions/MEMORY_USAGE_GUIDELINES_GORKA.instructions.md`

**Focus on capturing:**
- Testing strategies and quality patterns
- Risk assessment and coverage decisions
- Test data management approaches
- Quality gates and acceptance criteria
- Performance and reliability requirements

**Example testing concepts to store:**
- `GraphQLMocking_TestPattern` - how to mock GraphQL consistently
- `TestDataBuilder_Pattern` - creating maintainable test data
- `RegressionTesting_Strategy` - preventing quality degradation
- `PerformanceBaseline_Rule` - what performance levels are acceptable

**IMPORTANT**: Only create test documentation files (.md) when the user explicitly requests documentation. Focus on test implementation and memory knowledge capture.

## Multi-Perspective Test Design (ultrathink)

When designing comprehensive tests, analyze from:

1. **User Perspective**: What can go wrong for users?
2. **Security Perspective**: What vulnerabilities exist?
3. **Performance Perspective**: Where are the bottlenecks?
4. **Reliability Perspective**: How does it fail?
5. **Maintainability Perspective**: Will tests break easily?

## Iterative Test Enhancement

1. **Initial Tests**: Basic happy path
2. **Edge Cases**: "What unusual inputs break this? (think harder)"
3. **Error Scenarios**: "How does it fail? (ultrathink)"
4. **Performance Limits**: "When does it slow down?"
5. **Security Holes**: "Can this be exploited?"
