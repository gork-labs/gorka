# Agent System Quick Reference

## Thinking Mode Triggers
- `think` - Extended reasoning
- `think hard` - Deeper analysis
- `think harder` - Complex problems
- `ultrathink` - Maximum reasoning

"Review and refine this design"
```

### Software Engineer
```
"Implement [feature] following patterns"
"Think harder about edge cases"
"Optimize this for performance"
"Add comprehensive error handling"
```

### Design Reviewer
```
"Review this design thoroughly (ultrathink)"
"Update document with feedback"
"Approve/reject with reasons"
"Check security implications"
```

### Test Engineer
```
"Create comprehensive test strategy"
"Analyze failure modes (ultrathink)"
"Design performance tests"
"Document test patterns"
```

### DevOps Engineer
```
"Design scalable infrastructure"

## Status Workflow
```
draft ‚Üí under_review ‚Üí needs_revision ‚Üí under_review ‚Üí approved
                    ‚Üì
                 rejected
```

## Review Indicators
- üî¥ Critical (must fix)
- üü° Important (should fix)
- üü¢ Suggestion (consider)
- ‚úÖ Approved
- ‚ùå Rejected

## Performance Targets
- Response time: <100ms
- Test coverage: >80%
- Memory health: >85/100
- Documentation: Complete

## Always Remember
1. Use datetime MCP for timestamps
2. Query memory before creating
3. Document decisions with rationale
4. Think deeper for complex problems
5. Review and refine iteratively
